              <p>My name is Rafael Matera, and I’m a Computer Engineer with over 10 years of experience working as a software developer. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to collaborate on a wide range of projects across different industries and companies, helping individuals and businesses build functional, reliable, and user-focused digital solutions.</p>
              <p>I specialize in full-stack JavaScript development, working with technologies such as React, Node.js, Webpack, and various AWS services. I'm also highly proficient in Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket, and I have solid experience working with both SQL and NoSQL databases like MySQL and MongoDB. Additionally, I’ve worked extensively with WordPress and Shopify — building custom templates, plugins, and storefronts tailored to each client’s unique needs.</p>
              <p>My goal is to help bring your ideas to life by transforming them into practical, high-quality digital tools. Whether you need a marketing site, an eCommerce platform, or a complex web application, I can guide you through the process and build a solution that aligns with your vision and goals.</p>
